- I worry a little about my sense of humor, I hope Berhane especially understands when I joke. If he doesn't, or doesn't like my sense of humor, I hope he tells me so, so that I stop. I don't want it to make a problem.

- I feel that I managed to get a bit more done today, but while making some progress with this subject, it also downed on me how big a task this project actually is/requires. Especially if we're going to follow the level of detail that I'm doing right now.

- I think our group works well, as it has since the beginning. No conflict worth speaking of in our group at all so far (as long as my first worry in this reflection is not a problem). I (and others in the grou) are getting the feeling that we may need to actually have a conflict, so that we can write about it in our process report. (Even if I admit it's a bit incredoulus that our cooperation has gone so smoothly).
