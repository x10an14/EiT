Today was a good day process and group-wise. We managed to discover some discrepancies in
expectations about the project and sort them out, as well as reiterate expectations regarding work/effort in the group.

The feedback exercise went fine, besides Sajana feeling offended of my low grade of her attention in the group.
We found out by discussing why that this was a difference of opinion on what the question asked. I had only given
her a grade for quantity of time she had been the attention of the group, while she had also graded herself with
regards to how easily, how efficiently, the quality of the attention she got from the group when she needed it.
Hence, I agreed that my grade was wrong according to the criteria she understood.

I want to ask the group about how they think of my way of being. What is it that makes my personality go over so
well with them in the group? What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong?
