We had a conflict today in the Feedback Exercise by Are Holen

The progress report after lunch helped Sajana and Masomeh feel more included in the group. (SITRA!)

Sai: Thinks the group atmosphere is working very well, helping with the productivity.
There are no people working anti-constructive.

Sai also thinks that the after-lunch progress report is a good idea and works well.

Sajana think we're fitting well personality wise in the group.

Sajana feels that the progress evaluation after lunch helped her understand that she was hindering
the progress of the group, seeing as she was a key member of the group for this project.

Maso: Thinks that our evaluation was good with regards to quality, seeing as we're doing a good
job of evaluating with regards to time and completion. The latter helps us do a better job of
evaluating the former.

Ber: Liked the feedback exercise by Are Holen, since he felt it helped the group as a whole, but
also made him feel better about himself and his role/position in the group. He liked the idea
of doing more exercises like this, or repeat this exercise at a later point with the group.

Long discussion about how I work well with the group, Masomeh brought up the idea of my experience
with foreigners, compared to other norwegians. Berhane felt that my humor helped, and Saidee felt my
constructive directness helped.
