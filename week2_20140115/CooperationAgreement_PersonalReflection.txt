- I expect people to speak up when they feel like they have something to say.
	-It is then the remaining team-members responsibility to allow that person to say something

- I expect people to have, and show, patience
	-Both for letting people understand your thoughts/perspective, and for you to understand theirs.
	(This will be difficult due to cultural barriers and the language barrier)

- Important factors when I cooperate with others in a group:
	I need to be patient.
	I need to be less direct, be more "soft"/political in how I address and approach people/things
	It would be of great help to me if my teammembers could be patient with me, but it is not fair for me to ask for something I myself fail at.

- Personal preferences which can explain my personality:
	I prefer to work in a structured environment.
	Roles relatively (as the situation allows) declared and defined roles within the group.
