Today went quite well.
Not having a schedule we needed to follow increased productivity.

We had the same nice atmosphere, managed to agree on project report structure,
social event, and some generic deadlines.

I get the feeling that Mihail does not like it when I try to make sure that the
English in our reports is good/correct. I struggle to make him see that it's not
irrelevant how our English is.

He disagreed strongly that bad English could give us a bad grade.
