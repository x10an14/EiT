Today was a... shall we say, in one way, a boring day? Not much happened, and
the lack of oxygen in the room is really hurting my ability to focus and
concentrate.

However, the groupwork went fine as usual I think. We all seem to be very
independent of Sajana, but that is to be expected. I hope she doesn't feel any
undue pressure because of our expectations.

During the Group Feedback Exercise we each scored very positive on each our
forms. The only "variable", or negative aspect could be that we're not sure
we're doing all we can, and that there has been two (very minor) incidents of
not heeding rules/deadlines.

We decided to discuss later if we would meet up at an extra time during the week
to work, seeing as some in the group (Christian and Saidee) both said they don't
get much work done at home. They prefer to meet up with a group.

Otherwise I felt that we were pretty effective, if you keep in mind that it
wasn't easy to be so in the first place due to lack of oxygen and general noise
in the room from the other groups.
